# Hello, I'm Chen (Benjamin) Hsieh 👋

## Background

I majored in **Horticulture** and did research on tropical crops, such as bananas and bitter melons, at **National Taiwan University**. I then moved to the US to study **bioinformatics** at the **University of Georgia**, where I worked on gene duplications and de novo genes in Populus.

Currently, I'm writing my **PhD dissertation** while exploring new opportunities in tech and research.

## What I'm Up To

Right now I'm spending most of my time on:

1. 📝 Writing my PhD dissertation
2. 🏋️ Running a program for a powerlifting mock meet
3. 💼 Learning about case interviews

## Side Projects & Hackathons

I enjoy working on side projects and making new friends at the same time. Some highlights:
