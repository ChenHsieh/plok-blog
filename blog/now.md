# What I'm Up to Now

Inspired by Derek Sivers' [now page](https://nownownow.com/about) concept, here's what I'm focusing on right now:

## Primary Focus Areas

1. **📝 Writing my PhD dissertation** - The final stretch of my bioinformatics journey at UGA
2. **🏋️ Running a powerlifting mock meet program** - Combining my love for fitness with community building
3. **💼 Learning about case interviews** - Exploring new career opportunities beyond academia

## Intentional Practices This Week

I'm being deliberate about:

- **🔵 Using [Opal](https://applink.opal.so/invite-friend?rc=B5TEK&rId=QjsfQksvMFPb7ewqkXjY39I1Lcj1&rNme=vibrator0111) to reduce screen time** - Add me: `vibrator0111`
- **🌐 Switching browsers** - Moving from Arc and Dia to [Comet](https://plex.it/referrals/1M578RXH) and Brave
- **🗣️ Learning languages on DuoLingo** - Add me: `CH29576`
